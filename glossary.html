          inherit is a value that can be used for a lot of CSS
          properties that indicate the property of this elementâ€™s value is the
          same value as the parent element. This is also the default selection
          if the property is not declared separately.

          Pseudo-Classes

          Pseudo-classes are used to declare the state of an
          element and can be used to style how an element acts upon interaction,
          before/after being interacted with, select certain children of the
          element itself, etc. We thought this translation is the closest to
          create a touch based interaction between the user and the website as
          'hand' may offer.

          Padding is referred to the outside area of an element between the element and its parent.

          in between each other.

          this is the name of the craft that kind of works like embroidery. Using fabrics instead of
          fabric, it is the craft of creating a design with scraps sewn one on top of another.
